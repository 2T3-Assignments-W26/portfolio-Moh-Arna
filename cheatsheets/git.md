# Git Cheat Sheet



I've learned how to initialize a repo (local and remote), add a file to staging area, committing, getting the status of a repo, cloning a repo.





Initializing a local repo: git init inside the main Parent.

Initializing a remote repo: Make a repo in GitHub, and off of the quick setup grab the remote repository url, and use the url with git remote add origin REMOTE-URL-HERE (make sure to push the changes using git push origin main)



add a file to the staging area: git add NAME-HERE



committing a file: git commit -m "MESSAGE HERE"



getting the status of a repo: git status



cloning a repo: Click on the code button in GitHub, choose clone with https option, copy the url, and use the command git clone HTTPS-URL-COPIED-HERE



I used: git config --global core.editor "code --wait" 

to configure the editor to VS code.
